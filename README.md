# 🥐 scones.ike.coffee

**Order Fulfillment | Mass Text Interface | Referral Program**

## Overview

**scones.ike.coffee** is a microbakery I started in South Minneapolis. From day one, I’ve built the business iteratively around a simple idea:  
**Sell delicious scones—and make it feel personal.**

## 💻 Tech Stack

- **SvelteKit** – Full-stack framework for frontend and backend
- **Mongoose** – MongoDB ORM for database interactions
- **Twilio Messaging API** – For customer text notifications
- **Nodemailer** – For order email confirmations
- **Stripe API** – For secure payment processing

## 🚲 From Bike Deliveries to a Customer Platform

The first version of the site focused on bike delivery orders. That original `/order` route still exists and once drove early revenue of around **$200/month**. It accepted payments via Stripe and sent me email alerts whenever an order came in.

As the business grew, I realized I couldn't sustainably run delivery operations on my own. So I pivoted the site into a customer engagement platform—integrating:

- A **mass text messaging system** via Twilio
- A **referral program** where customers receive a unique link and earn free scones when friends sign up

When this README was written, I was focusing on selling scones from my porch two to three times a month.

## 📈 Roadmap

The long-term vision for scones.ike.coffee is to evolve it into a lightweight POS and customer marketing tool—something like a friendly, open-source alternative to Square.

Eventually, the site will host a crowdfunding campaign to support this next phase, as well as starting a brick and mortor location.

Building scones.ike.coffee has been fantastically educational to me, and made me a better grassroots marketer and software developer. I am excited for what is to come.
